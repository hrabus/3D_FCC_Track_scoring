#    ----- Parameters for lattice orientation
# When the ion trajectory passes the origin of the lattice, three Euler rotations are sufficient for defining
# relative position and alignment of track and lattice. The first (azimuthal) Euler rotation accounts for the
# rotational symmetry of the track structure around the primary particle trajectory, i.e. the positions of interactions
# are rotated around the straight line representing the trajectory. In principle, this rotation can be omitted as the
# rotational symmetry of track structure is already accounted for by scoring a large number of primary particle tracks.
# It may, however, be beneficial to include this azimuthal rotation to improve scoring statistics.
# The second and third rotation serve to establish the orientation in space of the primary particle trajectory with
# respect to the chosen coordinate frame. In the simulation setup, the trajectory of the primary particle is a natural
# choice for one of the cartesian coordinate axes, and we shall assume that it would be the z axis of this cartesian
# coordinate system associated with the particle track. In order to assess the targets receiving interactions, the
# coordinates (a,b,c) with respect to the lattice must be determined and then rounded to the nearest integer.
# This can be achieved by applying the composition of the three Euler rotations to each of the points of ionizing
# interactions in the track and then taking the scalar products with the adjoint vectors that represent the basis
# of the reciprocal space.
# It is computationally much more efficient to apply the inverse transformation once to the base and adjoint vectors
# of the lattice for a certain orientation of the primary particle trajectory and the lattice.
# To assess the dependence of the result on the relative orientation of track and lattice two different approaches can
# be followed. In the first approach, the values of \theta, \phi1 and \phi2 are randomly sampled from uniform
# distributions in the domains [0,\pi/2], [0,2\pi] and [-pi/3,\pi/3], respectively. (This spherical triangle is the 
# fundamental domain of the octahedral symmetry group.)
# In the second approach (which is implemented in module common_bravais_lattice_init.py, deterministic sampling is 
# applied such that the considered orientations of the primary particle trajectory is approximately uniformly 
# distributed in the spherical triangle defined by aforementioned domains for \theta and \phi2. 
# This is achieved by subdividing the spherical triangle into 4**MDIV equal triangles, of which some are pointng up
# (polar angles theta_plus) and some are pointing down (polar angles theta_minus).
